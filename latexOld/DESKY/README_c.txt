  Short HOWTO for Template of Theses' Cover
   In order to keep the design of all submitted theses similar-looking, proposed
layout must be followed, including all the information.  This is ensured when
binding is done at this company: Powerprint, Zikova 19. Binding may be done
at any other business.  In that case, the correct look of the cover is in your
responsibility. Note these possible issues:

   - all the proposed information must be included in correct order and letter
     case:

       1.NAME OF THE UNIVERSITY AND FACULTY,

       2.CTU logo,

       3.thesis' title,

       4.THESIS' TYPE,

       5.year & first name and SURNAME incl. academic degrees;

   - font, especially metrics (size, width),

   - exact layout.

   Shelf back should include information in the following format:
year (left)     TYPE OF THESIS (centre)     Name and SURNAME (right)
   Use this template with LATEX 2e (TeXLive 2010 recommended).
